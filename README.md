# Create React App interview assessment for RENCI

This app was created to assist students in practicing their addition in a game-ified manner to inspire attainment of basic math skills. The app will generate two random whole numbers as well as the correct sum of the two numbers, maintaining all 3 as internal state but only displaying to the user the two randomly generated numbers. The user enters an answer, and their answer is checked against the sum previously generated and stored. An alert will display after the submit button is clicked telling the user whether or not they answered correctly.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Setting up the environment with dependencies

  #### Node.js
  node.js is of course required and likely already installed if you are wanting to contribute to this codebase. If not, download node [here](nodejs.org).

  #### Create React App
  You can do a global install by running `npm install -g create-react-app`. 
  
  #### Axios
  Axios is the HTTP client communicating with the API in this app because it allows a more performant, powerful HTTP requests than vanilla JS. Install Axios by running `npm i axios` in your integrated terminal. Then, simply use an import statement at the top of the .js file where

## Available Scripts

Within the terminal of the project directory, you can run:

  ### `npm start`

  This runs the app in development mode.
  Then, open a browser window and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

  Due to the nature of React, the page will reload and update while you make changes to the code.

  ### `npm test`
  
  This will launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
  See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
  
  ### `npm run build`
  
  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
  The React app will be correctly bundled in production mode and optimally performant.
  The app is at this point ready for deployment.
  Review the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  ### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
